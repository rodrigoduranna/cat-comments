As a programming student, I find that the slow paced teaching is essential for beginners who know next to nothing, but is also very beneficial for advanced users. The thing is, I find that even if I know most of the knowledge taught in a lesson, I always find that there tend to be many subtleties that tend to enhance your proficiency and critical thinking. \n\nFor example, in this video, I would say that I knew many of the things here. I'm relatively familiar with the basic commands, and if I had to choose between whether or not I needed to watch this video, I would say that I didn't need it. But I did still learn a lot of really useful tricks that I didn't know about. Things like auto complete coords, Ctrl middle click, and stopping the day cycle at 500 so you can easily identify direction without pulling up f3, are all very useful little tips and tricks that I don't really need, but will definitely make my command block programming much more efficient. \n\nIn any case, I love how this first video turned out. looking forward to watching more."}, {"replies": [null], "author": "Lucas Seltaeb", "content": "As for what I personally know, I found this Episode 1 (although I knew everything you said) very refreshing.

This series will help you learn step-by-step using the 1.9 snapshots of Minecraft for PC.\n\nThis episode covers\n- creating an appropriate world environment for command block programming\n- the basics of absolute versus relative coordinates\n- a few basic commands (/spawnpoint, /setworldspawn, /setblock)\n- a few important buttons/controls\n- obtaining your first command block\n\nTeaching programming to a wide audience is a challenge. I'll try to go at a slow, detailed pace that most viewers can follow. If you know a topic well, you might want to watch at 1.5x or 2x speed to skim.\n\nTeaching complicated subject matter is a challenge. During an episode, I sometimes do 'handwaving', or tell white lies or lies of omission, for simplicity to teach beginners. At the end of each epsiode, I'll have a segment where I try to clear up the lies I know I told, going into more gory detail.\n\nSubscribe for more videos & tutorials here:\n\nThis playlist:\n\nFollow me on twitter @lorgon111 :", "title": "Learning Minecraft Command Block Programming, Part 1 - Setup"}
